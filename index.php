		<img src="images/CJM_Promo_Pictures/cornelljordan-promopix4.jpg" class="pic right" /><span>Three simple words describe Cornell Jordan and truly epitomize his personality, approach to ministry, and means to see the Holy Spirit move. In a phrase Cornell Jordan is:</span><br>
		<span>"<b>PASSIONATE</b>, <b>PRACTICAL</b>, & <b>POSITIVELY CHALLENGING</b>"</span><span>Unlike most evangelists, Cornell is known for his creative messages, unique illustrations, and infectious personality. A true "discipleship nut," he's driven to see to it that this generation understands the importance of a strong foundation of faith in Christ Jesus.</span><br><br>
		<span>A veteran in youth ministry for nearly 20 years, he now travels as an evangelist, spreading the Gospel to students and adults all across America and overseas. Most recently, he has traveled to the nation of Kenya for ministry and leadership training and is serving at the Amherst Foursquare Church in Ohio as interim youth pastor.</span><br>
